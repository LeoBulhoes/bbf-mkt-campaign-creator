## Quick Start

### 1. Open this folder in Antigravity

Open this folder as a workspace in [Google Antigravity](https://antigravity.dev).

### 2. Install the Blotato MCP Server

Blotato is how your agent posts to social media (Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, LinkedIn, etc.). You need to connect it as an MCP server in Antigravity.

1. Open your MCP config file. In Antigravity, press `Ctrl+Shift+P` → search for **"MCP: Open User Configuration"**
2. Add the following entry inside the `"servers"` object:

```json
"blotato": {
  "serverUrl": "https://mcp.blotato.com/mcp",
  "headers": {
    "blotato-api-key": "YOUR_BLOTATO_API_KEY_HERE"
  }
}
```

3. Replace `YOUR_BLOTATO_API_KEY_HERE` with your Blotato API key (get one at [my.blotato.com](https://my.blotato.com) → API settings)
4. Save the file — the MCP server will connect automatically

### 3. Set Up API Keys

1. Copy `references/.env.example` to `references/.env`
2. Fill in your API keys:
   - **`GOOGLE_API_KEY`** — Free from [aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) (for Nano Banana Pro image generation)
   - **`GCP_BUCKET_NAME`** — Your Google Cloud Storage bucket name (for file hosting)
   - **`AIRTABLE_API_KEY`** — From [airtable.com/create/tokens](https://airtable.com/create/tokens) (for content management)
   - **`AIRTABLE_BASE_ID`** — From your Airtable base URL
   - **`BLOTATO_API_KEY`** — Same key you used in the MCP config above

### 4. Install Python Dependencies

```
pip install -r tools/requirements.txt
```

### 5. Create Your Airtable Table

Create a table called **Content** in your Airtable base. The full schema is listed in `.agent/AGENT_BASIC.md`.

### 6. Connect Your Social Accounts in Blotato

Head to [my.blotato.com](https://my.blotato.com) and connect the social media accounts you want to post to (Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, LinkedIn, etc.).

### 7. Start Creating!

Open the Antigravity chat and try:

- **Quick post:** *"Hey, post this image to Instagram and TikTok"* (drop an image in `references/[brandname]/products/`)
- **Schedule posts:** *"Schedule these 3 images across the week — one today, one tomorrow, one in two days"*
- **Full campaign:** *"Let's create a 30-day marketing campaign for my product"* (this runs the `/30-day-campaign` workflow)
