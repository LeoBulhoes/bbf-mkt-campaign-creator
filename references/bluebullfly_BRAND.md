## Brand Story

Bluebullfly creates trendy, high-quality kids and youth apparel — from everyday essentials to standout styles — built for every adventure. The brand combines playful energy with durable, performance-grade fabrics that survive playground battles, family trips, and daily wear.

## Target Audience

- **Where they hang out**: Facebook parenting groups, TikTok & Instagram (following mom-influencers and children's fashion tags), Pinterest boards for kids' outfits and back-to-school prep.

## **🎨 Brand Masking & Composition (CRITICAL)**

All content is overlaid with [Ad Mask.png](./brands/bluebullfly/ads/Ad Mask.png), which places the brand logo in the **Top-Left Corner**.
* **The "Top-Left" Dead Zone:** Do NOT place focal points (faces, product logos, or hands) in the top-left quadrant of the frame.  
* **The Framing Rule:** Every image/video prompt must force the subject to the center or right-third of the frame.


### **3 Video Generation (Veo 3.1)**

#### **The "Product-First" Video Formula**

Starting from the \[ad\], the subject wearing \*\*this \[product\]\*\* \[Motion Description\]. \[Camera Movement\]. \[Atmosphere\]. \[Framing Guardrail\].

* **Framing Guardrail:** "Maintain subject position in center-right; ensure no motion drifts into the top-left logo area."  
* **Recommended Camera Movement:** \* **Slow push-in:** Focuses on the center/right.  
  * **Orbit Right:** Reveals the product while moving away from the top-left zone.  
  * **Handheld tracking:** Keep the subject centered or to the right.

### **4 Implementation Logic**

* **Post-Processing:** After generation, the Ad Mask.png must be layered over the image/video to create the final ad asset.  
* **Review Step:** Verify in the review phase that no child's face or product detail is clipped by the top-left butterfly logo.

### Signature Phrases
- "Play All Day. Built to Last."
- "Ready for action!"
- "Cozy Warmth. Built for School."
- "Everyday Adventures"

### What We NEVER Do
- ❌ **No Guilt-Tripping:** Never make parents feel bad about their choices or messy kids.
- ❌ **No Overly Complex Jargon:** Keep it simple—no deep dives into fabric science unless it clearly explains a benefit (like "No chafing").
- ❌ **No Tween/Teen Slang:** Avoid trendy internet slang that might isolate parents or feel forced.
- ❌ **No High-Fashion Pretension:** Keep it grounded. We aren't a luxury runway brand; we are for the playground.

## Content Pillars

1. **Adventure Ready** — Kids playing, exploring, being active
2. **Quality Matters** — Material close-ups, durability proof
3. **Style That Stands Out** — Unique prints, color variety
4. **Back to School / Seasonal** — Timely hooks
5. **Parent Testimonials/UGC** — Social proof (future goal)
