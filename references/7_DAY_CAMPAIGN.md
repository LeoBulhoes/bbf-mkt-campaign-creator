# 🦋 Bluebullfly — 7-Day "Kickoff" Campaign

This campaign focuses on the core identity of Bluebullfly: **Play All Day. Built to Last.** We will mix high-motion videos (Veo 3.1) with high-detail static images (Nano Banana Pro) to establish brand authority across Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube Shorts.
